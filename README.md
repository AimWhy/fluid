Fluid
=====

Modules for fluid and dynamic applications development with QtQuick.

## Dependencies

In order to build and install Fluid you need Qt 5.1 or better with
at least the following modules:

* qtbase
* qtjsbackend
* qtdeclarative
* qtquickcontrols

## Build

Building Fluid is a piece of cake.

Assuming you are in the source directory, just create a build directory
and run cmake:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
```

## Installation

It's really easy, it's just a matter of typing:

```sh
make install
```

from the build directory.
